# Convolutional Autoencoder for Feature Extraction

This repository contains a part of the source code of my Final Degree Project in Computer Engineering, University of Zaragoza. For further information about this project, read the [project report](https://github.com/asabater94/Atari-DeepReinforcementLearning/blob/master/report.pdf) (spanish).


This project trains a convolutional autoencoder whose encoder will be the pretrained set of layers of the [main neural network](https://github.com/asabater94/Atari-DeepReinforcementLearning).

The execution script allows the use of several activation functions, dropout and, data normalization.
